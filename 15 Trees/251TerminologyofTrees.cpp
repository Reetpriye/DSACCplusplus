/*
==================TREE==================
Tree is a collection of nodes among those
nodes one node is taken as root node and
rest of the nodes are divided into
disjoint subset and each subset is a tree
or sub-tree.

=============PARENT & CHILD=============
A node is a parent to its very next
descendant or those children which is
connected with one edge.

================SIBLINGS================
Siblings are children of same parent.

===============DESCENDANTS===============
Descendants are set of nodes which can be
reached from particular node.

================ANCESTORS================
For any node, all the nodes along that 
path from that node to root node.

=================DEGREE=================
Degree of a node is number of children
it has.
Degree of a tree is pre decided. Degree
can be minimum three.

=============EXTERNAL NODES=============
External nodes/leaf nodes/terminal are
nodes with degree 0.

=============INTERNAL NODES=============
Internal nodes/non leaf nodes/non terminal 
are nodes with degree more than 0.

=================LEVEL==================
Level start from 1.
Root is at level 0 and incremented 
afterwards.
We count it by taking number of nodes.

=================HEIGHT=================
Height start from 0.
Root is at height 1 and incremented 
afterwards.
We count it by taking number of edges.

=================FOREST=================
A collection of tree is known as forest.
