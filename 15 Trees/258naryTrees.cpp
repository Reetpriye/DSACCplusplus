// Author: REET

/*
===============n-ary Trees===============
n is the degree of the tree.
No node should have children more than
the degree of the tree.
For 3-ary {0,1,2,3}
Q)Who will decide the degree of tree?
Ans: By looking we can't judge that.
Degree is pre decided. A binary tree can
also be a 3-ary tree if you are assuming
that.

===========Strict n-ary Trees===========
Every node can have either 0 or exactly
n children only.
