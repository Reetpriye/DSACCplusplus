/*
============FULL BINARY TREE============
A tree of height(h) having maximum
number of nodes.
n = (2^(h+1))-1

==========COMPLETE BINARY TREE==========
A complete binary tree of height(h) will
be a full binary tree up to (h-1) height
and in the last level the element will be
filled from left to right without
skipping any element and there should not
be any blank spaces between elements.
A full binary tree is always a complete
binary tree and a complete binary tree
needs not to be a full binary tree.
