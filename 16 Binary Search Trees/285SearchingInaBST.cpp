Let us suppose a BST,
          30
    15          50
10     20    40     60

Let's say we are searching for value 20
Make a temproary pointer T point on 
root node.
Check whether it is 20.
If not,the possibilities are as follow:
key element is greater:point T on right
key element is smaller:point T on left
In our case as 20 is smaller than 30 
make T point on 15.
Then keep repeating the above steps
until the element is found.
This way 20 will be just found in 3 
comparison.

Maximum time taken to compare & find
element depends on the height of the 
tree which varies from [log(n) <=h<= n]

Time taken for search = O(h)=O(log(n))

=======RECURSIVE SEARCH FUNCTION=======
rSearch(Node* t, int key) {
    if (t == NULL)
        return NULL;
    if (key == t->data)
        return t;
    else if (key < t->data)
        return rSearch(t->lchild, key);
    else
        return rSearch(t->rchild, key);
}
This is a tail recursion.
If a tail recursive function is 
converted into iterative function 
definitely we don't require a stack for
that.

=======ITERATIVE SEARCH FUNCTION=======
Node* Search(Node* t, int key) {
    while (t) {
        if (t->data == key)
            return t;
        if (t->data > key)
            t = t->lchild;
        if (t->data < key)
            t = t->rchild;
    }
    return NULL;
}
